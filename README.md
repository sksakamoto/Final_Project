# Final_Project

#This final project consists of a step counter to assist the user in tracking their activity levels throughout the day.
#The main menu will allow user to choose Create Account, Enter Activity, and View Metrics.
#In Create Account, the user will be able to create an account and enter the target daily number of steps they want to achieve.
#In Enter Activity, the user can input the activity and the duration.
  The program can then calculate the number of steps and subtract from the desired daily target.
  The program will contain a list/dictionary of several activities and their step count equivalents.
  The program can print congratulatory message when the number of steps is achieved.
  The program can print encouraging message and remaining steps when the number of steps is not yet achieved.
  The program can enable the user to store "favorite" activities for user convenience (store "favorite" activities by assigning to a variable that user can call by name).
#In View Metrics, the user can view average step counts over days, weeks, or months.
  The program can average step counts over specified ranges of time.
  The program can print graphs and visuals to enable user to view progress.
