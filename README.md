# Final_Project

#This final project consists of a step counter to assist the user in tracking their activity levels throughout the day.
#The main menu will allow user to choose Create Account, Enter Activity, and View Metrics.
#In Create Account, the user will be able to create an account and enter the target daily number of steps they want to achieve.
#In Enter Activity, the user can input the activity and the duration.
  #The program can then calculate the number of steps and subtract from the desired daily target.
  #The program will contain a list/dictionary of several activities and their step count equivalents.
  #The program can print congratulatory message when the number of steps is achieved.
  #The program can print encouraging message and remaining steps when the number of steps is not yet achieved.
  #The program can enable the user to store "favorite" activities for user convenience.
    #Store "favorite" activities by assigning to a variable that user can call by name.
#In View Metrics, the user can view average step counts over days, weeks, or months.
  #The program can average step counts over specified ranges of time.
